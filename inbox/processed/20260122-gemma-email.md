Thanks for all your help. The website is looking great!! Today I went ahead and added some tickets, products and FAQ's. Just a FEW things I have thought of:

TICKETS/REGISTRATION
Under the ticket section could you add 'Pit Crew" as a role? 
Can you also add the tab on the left like you have with merchandise to reorganise the tickets placement?

Our main tickets being MAAA Pilot Registration, MAAA Junior Pilot Registration and Pit Crew Registration include a 2026 FOA shirt in the pricing. Maybe once they enter all their details in the attendees details pop up, they hit next and it prompts another pop up with their shirt size/colour/men or women prompt. Also for the official dinner that is included in their ticket we would need to know dietary requirements if this could also be added?

ATTENDEES DETAILS
For both pilot and pit crew could you please add a box for their phone number please?

Under the pit crew registration could you add a section asking "Who is the pilot you will be accompanying?". 

HEAVY MODEL PERMITS
Do you have the link that we sent out to pilots last year with the 'terms and conditions' AKA MOP's in the pilots registration? If not, can I get that link sent through or let me know where I can add that info into the website?

In the case that someone who has registered has missed a heavy model permit or needs to add a new one- maybe under the my orders section is it possible for the pilot to see what heavy model permits they have uploaded and option to add more?

In addition to this, if we need to access those model permits is it possible to have a section on the admin side under settings or its own tab to access their uploads?

Let me know if i'm getting too much into it but under orders on the admin end, are you able to add a search bar for us to search individual orders or this will be something we will see on the database?

Sorry for all the questions! Hope you had a lovely day or so off. Speak soon!!
