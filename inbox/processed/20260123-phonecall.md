when asking if you have any heavy models, it needs to ask if you are a heavy model inspector. If yes, you don't need to register your planes. Show it as a Yes/No dropdown, defaulted to No, but if they change it to yes, then the planes section is hidden and they can continue with the registration process without adding planes.
