# Admin Camping Updates Implementation Plan

## Goal
Improve the Admin Camping experience by:
1.  Defaulting the "Event" dropdown to the current or next upcoming event in Admin tools.
2.  Removing the intrusive "Click map to place" tooltip/overlay from the Admin Map Tool to prevent it from blocking the map view.

## User Review Required
> [!NOTE]
> **Database Changes**: No database changes are required for this update. The requested Logic is entirely frontend-based.

## Proposed Changes

### Client

#### [MODIFY] [AdminMapTool.jsx](file:///c:/laragon/www/AERO-Project/client/src/pages/camping/AdminMapTool.jsx)
- **Logic**: Update `fetchEvents` (or the effect calling it) to sort events by date and automatically select the first event where `end_date >= today`. If no future events exist, default to the most recent one (or first in list).
- **Interface**: Remove the absolute positioned overlay div that says "Click map to place...". The cursor change to 'crosshair' (already implemented) will serve as the indicator.

#### [MODIFY] [CampingAvailabilityReport.jsx](file:///c:/laragon/www/AERO-Project/client/src/pages/admin/CampingAvailabilityReport.jsx)
- **Logic**: Ensure the `events` list is sorted by date before selecting the default. Currently, it relies on the API order which may be inconsistent.
- **Detail**:
    ```javascript
    // Sort logic to be added
    const sorted = data.sort((a, b) => new Date(a.start_date) - new Date(b.start_date));
    const active = sorted.find(e => new Date(e.end_date) >= new Date()) || sorted[sorted.length - 1]; // Future or latest
    ```

## Verification Plan

### Manual Verification
1.  **Admin Camping Report**:
    - Navigate to `/admin/camping-reports` (or equivalent link).
    - Verify that the "Event" dropdown is pre-selected with the current/next Air Show event.
    - Verify that the Start/End dates are pre-filled correctly.
2.  **Admin Map Tool**:
    - Navigate to `/admin/map-tool` (via Dashboard or URL).
    - Verify that the "Event" dropdown is pre-selected.
    - Select a Campground if not auto-selected.
    - Select a Site from the "Bulk Create" or "Single Site" list (or click an existing pin).
    - **Verify**: The black overlay "Click map to place..." does **NOT** appear.
    - **Verify**: The cursor changes to a crosshair, indicating placement mode is active.
