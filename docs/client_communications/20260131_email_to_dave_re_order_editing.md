Subject: Order Editing - Proposed "Removal Only" Approach

Hi Dave and Gemma,

Regarding the request to edit orders: adding items to an existing order is extremely complex and risky, as it requires rebuilding our entire checkout system (stock checks, waivers, variations) inside the Admin area.

**Recommendation: "Remove Only" for Pending Orders**
We propose building a feature that allows you to **remove items** from **Pending Orders only**.

This solves the main problem (handling out-of-stock items) quickly and safely:
1.  **Out of Stock?** You simply "Remove" the item from the order. The total updates automatically.
2.  **Need to Swap/Replace?** You remove the wrong item, and ask the customer to place a new order for the correct one.

This approach prevents data errors and allows us to deliver the feature immediately.

Are you happy for us to proceed with this?

Best,
Josh
