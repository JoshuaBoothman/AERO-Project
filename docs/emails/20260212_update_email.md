Subject: Update: New Homepage, System Enhancements & Next Steps

Hi Dave and Gemma,

We’ve just rolled out a significant update today (12-Feb-2026). Here is a summary of the changes and what’s coming next.

### 1. New Homepage Design
We have revamped the homepage to be a proper landing page rather than just redirecting to the event details. It now features specific sections for "About ALSM", "Premier Event", and links to National & State Associations.

**Please review the mockup below:**

### 2. Updates Rolled Out Today
In addition to the homepage, we’ve deployed several improvements and fixes:

*   **Asset Hire Options:** Added the ability to configure specific options for assets (e.g., selecting a Flight Line when hiring equipment). 
    *   *See screenshot below of the new selection dropdown:*

*   **Campsite Booking Extensions:** You can now book campsites for 1 day *before* the event starts and 1 day *after* it ends.
*   **Camping Report Upgrade:** The spreadsheet/grid view now displays the **Booker's Name** in the cell, rather than just an 'x', making it easier to see who is where at a glance.
*   **Pit Crew / Pilot Linking:** Fixed an issue where Pit Crew tickets weren't correctly linking to Pilots in the shopping cart.
*   **Asset Hires List:** Fixed a duplication issue in the admin list and added search/filter tools so you can easily find hires by name or status (Active/Returned).
*   **Mobile Improvements:**
    *   **Date of Birth:** Switched to a much easier-to-use 3-dropdown selector (Day/Month/Year) which works better on phones than the calendar view.
    *   **Store Tabs:** Improved the scrolling menu on the store page for mobile users.
*   **"Register Now" Button:** clearer navigation for users—directing them to the shop if logged in, or the login page if they are guests.

### 3. Next Steps (Project Roadmap)

Once you have approved the homepage and the above changes, we are ready to move to the final stages:

1.  **Square Payment Integration:** We will switch the "Mock" payment system to the live Square integration. This will allow real payments to be processed.
2.  **Data Cleanup:** We will wipe all the test data (test orders, test users) from the system.
3.  **Legacy Campsite Bookings:** Dave, this will be your cue to start adding the legacy campsite bookings using the "Book Past Attendee" tool we implemented previously.
4.  **Go Live:** Finally, we will point the domain name to the new app, and it will be live for the public!

Let me know if you have any questions or changes for the homepage!

Best,
Josh
